UAS applications for filming and photography and emergency response are common today but the use cases for logistics is an emerging market and at Raptor365, we have developed a prototype and tested it as well. Logistics is an emerging market and our custom made drones are ready to undertake this operation.</br></br>

MultiRotors (Helicopter Type) are most suitable for the logistics industry especially for short distances like urban first and last-mile connectivity, rural delivery & intralogistics.</br></br>

<b>FIRST & LAST MILE CONNECTIVITY</b></br>
Picking up from a location forms first mile connectivity and delivery to the final destination forms the last mile connectivity. Rapid urbanization is making first & last mile connectivity a problem area for cargo delivery. We anticipate the demand for this to be huge as e-commerce volumes increase every day . UAVs could provide major relief to inner cities, taking traffic off the roads and into the skies. We are one of the first organizations to have taken a futuristic step in the direction of aerial delivery.
Typically, shipments that arrive from outside the city limits are sorted at existing facilities (hubs, warehouses, cross- docking sites), and shipments meeting certain criteria are separated automatically. Each UAV automatically picks up assigned shipment from a dispatch area & take off. On its way back to the hub, the UAV could carry out point-to-point deliveries that lie on its route.</br></br>

Its routing decisions will always be dynamic, meaning an intelligent network would redistribute all resources in real-time, depending on the load and urgency of certain shipments. As an example, when an assignment for emergency transport comes in (e.g., time-critical delivery of blood from a blood bank), it gets prioritized automatically. End clients are equipped with an app that allows them to see nearby UAVs and order a dynamic pick-up – this system would use GPS data from the customer’s smartphone to meet him or her wherever they are, even if they move to a different location after placing the order. There will be the same flexibility for deliveries as well. As soon as the customer sends a notification, a UAV leaves the hub and makes delivery direct to the customer location or in case of returns, picks it up right from the first mile of the customer.</br></br>

The first and last meters of the delivery process are likely to be the most technically challenging. If the customer is outdoors and moving, the UAV could meet them and “hand-over” the delivery after identifying the customer via NFC or QR code on their smartphone. But if the customer is at home, things gets trickier. In cases where garden or balcony is available, the UAV could drop the parcel onto this. We can program the UAVs to land on the roof of large buildings and skyscrapers. The most problematic delivery would be to mid-sized buildings with pitched roofs – structures that are prevalent in European locations – necessitating an alternative delivery point, perhaps some sort of collection point. </br></br>

This urban first and last-mile use case is probably the most tangible and spectacular in the logistics industry. But it is also the application with perhaps the largest barriers, because privacy and safety concerns multiply in the densely populated urban environment. It is the most challenging in terms of regulatory framework conditions and infrastructure – especially integration into existing urban infrastructures.</br></br>

<b>RURAL DELIVERY</b></br>
The potential of UAV technology is also evident in rural locations with poor infrastructure or challenging geographic conditions. George Barbastathis of the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology initiated research into UAVs For the logistics industry, rural delivery by UAV is attractive not only in emergency applications because low-volume remote locations represent a costly part of standard networks. Furthermore, they typically require a non-standard infrastructure tailored to regional specifics (e.g., mountainous settings or island delivery).</br></br>
For remote island locations, a conceivable use case is the delivery of parcels to near-shore islands, either replacing an existing (and complex) process involving cars, boats, and postal workers, or providing new, additional services. These could be off-peak delivery services originating from the mainland or specific express services (e.g., for pharmaceutical delivery).This project clearly underlines the feasibility of UAV-based deliveries in a real-world setting. A widespread use, however, will still need time.</br></br>

UAVs offer greatest advantage to infrastructures that are weak or almost non-existent. For example, in rural Europe aerial deliveries via a UAV network could speed up deliveries and raise service levels, but in rural Africa this could be a complete game changer. Remote communities in developing nations often lack access to proper roads and train lines. Connecting villages through UAV delivery networks could enable their participation in the global economy and more frequent supply of critical goods.</br></br>
This would, in turn, speed up economic development, as at some level the use of UAVs overcomes the expensive and time-consuming task of establishing infrastructure.</br></br>


<b>INTRALOGISTICS</b>
UAVs could play a vital role in intralogistics. Consider the automotive industry with its massive production sites, just-in-time processes, and mind-boggling cost of idle production lines: UAVs could support intra-plant transport as well as the supplier-to-plant emergency deliveries which are typically performed by helicopter today. Large-scale mining areas could also profit from the on-site express delivery of items that are crucial to maintaining operations (e.g., delivery of tools, machine parts, and lubricants).</br></br>
UAVs are easy to deploy and can follow pre-defined flight paths, so there is no requirement for specially trained personnel to launch and fly them. As long as system operations are limited to private premises only, the organization has to deal with minimal regulatory boundaries and privacy concerns (issues that can be so detrimental that they render other use cases unfeasible). The most significant limitation for intralogistics is probably the payload issue. Smaller, affordable UAVs are still disappointingly expensive, and large unmanned helicopters almost rival their manned counterparts in terms of cost, maintenance, and infrastructure requirements, eliminating their major advantages.</br></br>
Another imaginable intralogistics application is the use of UAVs inside the warehouse environment for more flexible and accessible high-bay storage.  This concept is based on the internet of things, focusing on self-organization of machines and interaction among systems. The sensors allow the system to independently observe and analyze the surrounding environment so that the UAV is able to navigate through a warehouse, find logistical objects and carry out an inventory check. The information collected is also transmitted to third-party systems via intelligent interfaces and services. This allows the direct transfer of selected context-related information.</br></br>
